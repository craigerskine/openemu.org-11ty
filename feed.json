Believe it or not, the original design specs accounted for this scenario so there was very little 'design' work that had to be added. It was just a matter of building out the frontend.</p>\n<p><strong>Plans for this section:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Developer updates</li>\n<li>Design processes</li>\n<li>Other vide game emulation news</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"text-sm\">So, get ready for some really cool articles and news updates. And if you are a real nerd you subscribe to these updates via a <a href=\"https://craigerskine.github.io/feed.json\">JSON feed</a>.</p>\n",
