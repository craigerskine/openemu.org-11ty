    Why restrict yourself to just the keyboard? Although it is not a requirement, OpenEmu is best used with a peripheral gamepad or controller to interact with your games.
    <br /><br />
    Via the Controller Preferences, simply auto-magically assign buttons with any generic HID compliant USB or Bluetooth game controller.
    <br /><br />
    Plug in your gamepad, select it from the list... and press start to begin your adventures!

      lead: One of the standout features of OpenEmu is how it organizes all your games into one unique, unified games library. Watch as backups of the games (ROMs) you already own are gracefully added to their appropriate library and box art is magically added. You can even create your own ‘collections’ mix and matched from different consoles.
